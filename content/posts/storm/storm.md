quotes:
  - "Lightning sketches the outline of tomorrow long before we dare to speak it aloud."
  - "Between thunderclaps I can hear the quiet work of every idea learning to fly."
  - "Not every wave knows the shore, yet each of them keeps trying; so do we."
  - "Rainfall is just a metronome for people who build patiently in the dark."
  - "Hold your compass to the windâ€”if it hums, you are still moving."
  - "When the clouds finally break, remember who you became to wait that long."
