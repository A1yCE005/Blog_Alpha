# One who chase



One who grown under a dome, will be hysterical when confronting the sky.



One in the bizarre story who witnesses tragedies, will become creator of another tragedy.



One in the uncognitionable history who derive from the endless darkness, will become a sprinkling meteor.



Fragmentary pieces in memory, will become a scalpel which reshape you recurrently.



Pale blossoms under windmill, will be the revealer of reticence former.



It’s said that,one who chase the sun, will become the ender of turbulence.



One who chase, One stouthearted, One prophesied,please go and fly.



Go and fly, before this land crumble, before the wind dissolve——before everything started.
