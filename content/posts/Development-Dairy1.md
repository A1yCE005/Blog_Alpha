Recruiting **AFlodit** as 3D Modeller, Lighthouse (actually not only this blog, but also our team's name) is going to reach its great advent. With the recent establishment of our task tracker, each team member is now clearly aware of their responsibilities, giving us the feeling of becoming increasingly professional and efficient.

AFlodit primarily uses 3DMax, while ty and I am accustomed to Blender. Although we initially had concerns regarding potential workflow inconsistencies, our main operations will focus on Unreal Engine's subsystems, such as Nanite and Landscape Editor, so theoretically the choice of different modelling software won't make a difference. We simply creating plain model in specific software.

In collaboration with sghy, we've significantly refined our game mechanics to better align with our worldview. It's a couple of brand new system, e.g., player can decide to what extent he want when executing magic dices, which will reflected on how much MP he will use. 

We also distinguished the concept between pure magic and element magic, which was a significant idea in Ragriff (the world where the game happens). Differ from common notion, when executing fireball spell, you CANNOT create a fireball from nothing. Instead, elemental magic requires an existing elemental source, such as an actual flame for a fireball spell. Elemental spells are thus dependent on the environment or props that generate the required element. To balance this constraint, elemental damage carries significant impact due to the rarity of elemental resistances.

Currently, sghy is diligently implementing these mechanicsâ€”best of luck to him.

On the design side, tasks continue to progress smoothly. I've completed drafting the Solution part of our story "Rock Beneath" and have now transitioned to the Mystery segment. Grove has began drafting the revenge story of Tithiel, our female protagonist.

Our chief artist, Murlowrain started working on design UI for the inventory system, good luck to her too.
